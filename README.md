# Temporary Personal Website
This is a super simple personal website that I threw together to be a more professional-looking hub for my professional links while 
I work on building the real personal website I've been building out. I used Claude to build the original boilerplate html and css, and then
I went through and tweaked everything to match my intended designs. Total time to build: 1 Hour :)
